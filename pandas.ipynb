    "Here is an (incomplete) list of some key functionalities provided by Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  __Data Structures__\n",
    "    -   _Series_: One-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.\n",
    "    -   _DataFrame_: Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).\n",
    "2.  __Data Manipulation__\n",
    "    -   _Data Selection and Indexing_: Access data via labels, indices, or boolean masks (`.loc`, `.iloc`, `.at`, `.iat`).\n",
    "    -   _Filtering_: Filter data based on conditions or queries.\n",
    "    -   _Sorting_: Sort data by labels or values.\n",
    "    -   _Handling Missing Data_: Identify, fill, or drop missing values (`isnull`, `dropna`, `fillna`).\n",
    "3.  __Data Cleaning__\n",
    "    -   _Dropping Duplicates_: Remove duplicate rows or columns.\n",
    "    -   _Replacing Values_: Replace specific values in the DataFrame.\n",
    "    -   _String Operations_: Perform operations on string data, like splitting, replacing, and pattern matching (`str.split`, `str.replace`).\n",
    "4.  __Aggregation and Grouping__\n",
    "    -   _Group By_: Split data into groups based on criteria, and perform aggregate functions like sum, mean, or custom operations.\n",
    "    -   _Pivot Tables_: Create a pivot table to summarize data.\n",
    "5.  __Merging and Joining__\n",
    "    -   _Concatenation_: Combine multiple DataFrames along a particular axis.\n",
    "    -   _Merging_: Merge DataFrames similar to SQL joins (`merge`, `join`).\n",
    "6.  __Time Series__\n",
    "    -   _Datetime Conversion_: Convert date and time data to a datetime object.\n",
    "    -   _Resampling_: Aggregate data over a time period.\n",
    "    -   _Time-based Indexing_: Access and manipulate time-series data easily with date indexing.\n",
    "7.  __Statistical and Mathematical Operations__\n",
    "    -   _Descriptive Statistics_: Compute summary statistics for DataFrame columns.\n",
    "    -   _Correlation/ Covariance_: Calculate the pairwise correlation or covariance between columns.\n",
    "    -   _Cumulative Operations_: Perform cumulative operations on data.\n",
    "\n",

You can think of it as a collection of Series objects, where each Series is a single column of data. DataFrames provide a highly efficient way to store and manipulate large datasets in memory."
